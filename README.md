# GLSL-Shaders-Library

Shader library tested in OpenGL. The shaders are developed with **GLSL**. Below you can see the shaders applied in a real environment. In case you want to test you can download the following [repository](https://github.com/JorgeBarcena3/OpenGL-Shaders-template), and replace the files, "fragmentShader.fglsl" and "vertexShader.vglsl", located in the "assets" folder.

## 01.- Texture-blend-center

This shader applies a certain color as we get closer to the center of the texture applied to the object.
